# honors and awards

### "Excellent New Student Award", Mar. 2017

This award is meant for those new students who did great in the first semester. There was no certificate for it. For the first semester, I was placed into the School of Environment. But I wasn't upset and acquired the top achievements among my classmates. Therefore, I was awarded with it.

### "Merit Student Award", Oct. 2017 & Oct. 2019

This award is meant for those "merit students". This honor is given to those students who have been doing well both in study and community life. For the first year, I was elected as "Youth League Secretary" of my first class. I and the class monitor held a lot of activities for our classmates and built the foundation for the class as a unified group. As for the grades, I was among the top 10% of my college peers. For the third year, I have participated in multiple researches and competitions. As for the grades, I was ranked at the top 7%

### "The Third Prize", May 2018

It seems to be a tiny award, but it means a lot to me. I competed in the 11th Central China Mathematic Modelling Contest of University Students, together with two of my dormmates. It was the first time that I took part in a similar competition. We literally had no idea of how to finish it before, but we nailed it with a third prize awarded. It was never a bad result for beginners.

### "Honorable Mention", Apr. 2019

I was intrigued by the first mathematical modelling contest I took part in, so I got myself prepared and signed up for another one. Before this competition, I learned MATLAB (licensed to the university) and read a few
relevant books about mathematical modelling. We, two of my classmates and me, went through the Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (ICM) during the spring festival. It was an unforgettable experience. The contest was finished at the beginning of 2019, but the result didn't reach until April. 

### "Excellent Reader", Apr. 2019

I have been an avid reader since I was a little child. My mother read the first book I ever encountered, Two Thousand Leagues, to me at every night before I fell asleep. I never drop this habit. I would pick up a book from the main library and went to the stone chairs in the woods or by the lake, spending a whole afternoon in the nature. Surprisingly and unsurprisingly, I was awarded as an "Excellent Reader" by the main library.

### More to come...

These were the most memorizable and valuable honors and awards to me, but not all that I got. I believe that there are more to come.
