# Greenere.github.io

This is a personal page of mine.

**Why Greenere?**

At first, I wanted to go with Green. 

This was an English alias I named myself during my junior high school, it came from an article in textbook originally, but I thought it was a nice name and took it. 

"Green" here has no relegious hint, it's a representation of the green beings all around the world, standing for the ever growing life and strength.

But the username "Green" had been taken when I signed up Github, therefore I added an exotic tail "ere" to it to form a weird but prononciatable word as my username. 

"ere", as in "here", "there", "were", has a hint for existing in my mind (although it's totally personal). "Greenere", I wish it to express a feeling of being surrounded by vivid life, like in the deep center of forest. That's the feeling I have when I face the ocean of knowledge.
