            <b>Research description:</b> We developed a method for the black-box adversarial attack against offline handwritten signature verification system. A region-restricted perturbation was applied to the original signature to generate an adversarial example. We fooled the state-of-art signature verification system with a high success rate. A paper was drafted and it is on submission currently.<br>
<b>My role:</b> First author.<br>
<b>My contribution:</b> I developed the attack method, implemented it with Python and designed experiments to evaluate its performance. I also wrote the majority of the paper.
